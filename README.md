# DartMotion
A VR dart throwing game using Leap Motion, Oculus Rift, and Unity. Created for the HackMerced 2017 Hackathon. 

## How to run
An Oculus Rift, Leap Motion sensor, and Unity are all required if you wish to run this game. This repo only contains the code for the project, so you must either build an executable in Unity, or simply test it out in Unity. If you have the required equipment, you can clone this repository and open it as a project in Unity to test it out.
